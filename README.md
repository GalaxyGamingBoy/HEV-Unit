# HEV Unit (Hazardous Environment Unit)

The idea for the project is simple, build a simple weather/radiation detector station that monitors the environment and logs the information. It will also feature a geiger counter and volatile gas detector as such to alert the inhabitants of dangerous situations. It will feature a display with telemetry stats as well as a web monitoring software for remote access.
